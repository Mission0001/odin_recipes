  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This recipe is EASY to prep. You just need to chop the pork, mince the garlic, and then measure out the remaining
    ingredients for the marinade.
  </p>
  <p>You most likely have the ingredients for the marinade already at home. And if you don't, there are some easy common
    substitutes you can use (I share those in the recipe card).</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>
    <li>Calamansi juice</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
    <li>Ginger ale or 7-Up</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
    <li>Parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <li>Cut the pork shoulder into 1-inch to 2-inch cubes. Then mix all of the remaining ingredients (except parsley)
    together in a large bowl. </li>
  <li> Pour the marinade into a FoodSaver® Preserve and Marinate container. Then add in the pork pieces and toss to
    coat. Or, do this in a regular large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li> If using the FoodSaver® VS3110 food preservation system's handheld vacuum sealer to connect to the opening in the
    lid of the FoodSaver Preserve and Marinate containers. I press the Handheld button and this marinates the meat in
    just minutes, instead of hours!</li>
  <li>Thread the pork onto bamboo skewers or stainless steel metal skewers. Put about 4 to 5 pieces per skewer.</li>
  <li>Fire up the grill to medium-high. Add the skewers and grill for 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
  <li>Use the extra marinade sauce that you had set aside at the beginning and baste the pork meat on all sides as it
    grills.</li>
  </ol>
